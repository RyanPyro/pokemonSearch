I learned a lot from this personal Project. 
I learned how to fetch data from a public api.
I learned about promises.
I got to practice Try/catch.
I learned how to use Async.
I got to practice the map method which makes a new array by applying a function to
each element from a previous array.

I still have a lot to learn and practice but, this was pretty simple and fun.
